# Kanji Grid Kuuube

Kanji Grid Kuuube, Kanji Grid for Anki 23.10+ with improvements and bug fixes.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuuuube/kanjigrid/master/kanji_grid_banner.png)

## Installation

1. Open Anki.

2. On the top menu, go to `Tools` > `Add-ons`.

3. Click `Get Add-ons...`.

4. Input `1610304449`.

5. Click `OK`.

6. Restart Anki.

## Usage

1. On the top menu, go to `Tools` > `Generate Kanji Grid`.

2. Select the deck to generate from with the `Deck` dropdown.

3. Select the card field to check for kanji with the `Field` dropdown or type in multiple fields to check.

    Use the following format for searching multiple fields: `field1 field2 "field with spaces"`.

4. Optionally, edit any of the other settings to your liking.

5. Click `Generate`.

## Known Issues

Before troubleshooting your issue, restart Anki. Especially after updating addons, Anki can break if you do not restart.

1. On Linux, some users have experienced issues with crashing when generating the grid. If this happens, try changing Anki to `Vulkan` or `Software` renderer.

    `Tools` > `Preferences` > `Appearance` > `Video driver` > `Vulkan` or `Software`

2. In some cases, if you have edited the config file, you may run into issues. You can fix this by resetting the config:

    `Tools > Add-ons > Kanji Grid Kuuube > Config`, `Restore Defaults`, `Save`, Restart Anki.

3. `Kanji Grid` versions uploaded by other developers cannot be installed at the same time as `Kanji Grid Kuuube`.

    `Tools` > `Add-ons` > Select the intruding `Kanji Grid` add-on > `Delete`

## Custom Groupings

Extra options can be added to the `Group by` dropdown by adding the data files to Kanji Grid Kuuube. See [Grouping Data Format](https://github.com/Kuuuube/kanjigrid/blob/master/docs/grouping_data_format.md) for an explanation of the grouping data format.

User-defined groupings should be added in `/user_files/data/`. Do not place files in the main `/data/` folder as these files will be deleted when the addon is updated.

If you have created a grouping that you think is generally useful to users of the target language, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/Kuuuube/kanjigrid/pulls) on github with your additions. Groupings that are only useful to niche communities or individual users will not be accepted.
