![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kuuuube/kanjigrid/master/kanji_grid_banner.png)

## Installation

1. Open Anki.

2. On the top menu, go to `Tools` > `Add-ons`.

3. Click `Get Add-ons...`.

4. Input `1610304449`.

5. Click `OK`.

6. Restart Anki.

## Usage

1. On the top menu, go to `Tools` > `Generate Kanji Grid`.

## Known Issues

- On Linux, some users have experienced issues with crashing when generating the grid. If this happens, try changing Anki to `Vulkan` or `Software` renderer.

    `Tools` > `Preferences` > `Appearance` > `Video driver` > `Vulkan` or `Software`

## Config Values

- `pattern` The default text in the `Field` dropdown box. Controls which field(s) to look for kanji in. Defaults to the first field of the selected deck if no value is found.

- `interval` The default text in the `Card interval considered strong` box. Sets the interval for cards to be given the Strong color on the grid.

- `groupby` The default setting in the `Group by` dropdown. The first dropdown item is number 0.

- `sortby` The default setting in the `Sort by` dropdown. The first dropdown item is number 0.

- `lang` The default setting in the `Language` dropdown. This controls fontcss and search options.

- `unseen` Whether or not to display kanji that has not been viewed yet in the deck.

- `tooltips` Whether or not to display tooltips when hovering over kanji in the grid.

- `kanjionly` Whether or not to only show kanji in the grid.

- `saveimagequality` The quality to save the grid at when seleting `Save Image` on the grid. Accepted values are 0-5. WARNING: On large grids using anything except `1` may crash anki.

- `copyonclick` Copies kanji when clicked on instead of searching in a web browser or note browser.

- `browseonclick` Opens the Anki note browser when clicking on kanji instead of searching in a web browser.

- `saveimagedelay` The delay in ms to wait when resizing the image if `saveimagequality` is not 1. Setting this to a higher value may help mitigate crashes.
